#Running multiple tasks and processing the

	first result A common problem in concurrent programming is when you have various concurrent tasks that solve a problem, and you are only interested in the first result of those tasks. 
	
	For example, you want to sort an array. You have various sort algorithms. You can launch all of them and get the result of the first one that sorts these, that is, the fastest sorting algorithm for a given array.
